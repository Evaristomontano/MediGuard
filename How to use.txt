How to Use
Run the script:

    python main.py

*Calibration (Mandatory):

Sit Up Straight: Get into your ideal, comfortable posture.

Wait until the bottom status text turns yellow (meaning the system has a stable average).

Press the [C] key to save your ideal posture as the reference.

*Monitoring:

If your posture degrades, a countdown (Yellow Warning) starts.

If you fail to adjust within the time limit (default 5s), a loud Alert (Red) will sound.

*Customization
You can adjust the system's strictness in the main() function:

calibration_margin: Sets the tolerance (in degrees) before the warning starts. Lower value = more strict.

alert_duration_threshold: Time (in seconds) before the full alert is triggered.

Z_PROTRUSION_THRESHOLD (in process_posture_frame): Adjusts how sensitive the system is to you leaning close to the screen.
